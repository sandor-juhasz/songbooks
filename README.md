  of the notation can be found

- The best online ABC Music notation editor can be found

- The unit node length is 1/4 as specified in the header with the `L:1/4` line.

- Broken rhytm uses the shorthand, eg. instead of `C3/2C/`, use `C>C`.

- Notes in higher and lower octaves use apostrophes and commas, not lowercase.

- Additional lyrics is placed at the end of the document and it starts with
  an empty `W:` line.
